Hi all, thank you so much for the opportunity to help out on this project!

Please find my code attached, as well as a (somewhat lengthy) README to describe my methodology, a self-contained dashboard I made in Excel (along with the data and regressions), and a cipher for how I assigned values to responses.

I've pushed my work via Github (I think), but I also spent a fair bit of time analyzing the results and making them more tangible in the README and Excel Dashboard, so I wanted to share that in particular as well.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help.

Best,
Calvin
