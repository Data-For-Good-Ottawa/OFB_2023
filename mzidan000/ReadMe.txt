Hi everyone,

The PDF report presentation and the source code are attached here.

To replicate the results:
1- Place the 'neighbour_survey_clean-2024-06-14.csv' dataset in the same folder as the source files.
2- Run the main.py Python file.

To understand:
To understand the analysis approach, why there are multiple source code files, and what each source file does, please see Chapter 2 (5 short slides) in the PDF report presentation.

PDF report presentation vs sources codes:
 The PDF report presentation has 7 chapters. Each of these chapters has its comments in the main.py file, making it easier for you to replicate the results using the main.py file.

Future Work: 
Future work chapters in the PDF presentation (I did not have time to get to them):

Food Security Status and Transportation (addressed by Salma)

Food Security Status and Ethnicity (addressed by Salma)

Food Security Status and Newcomers (addressed by Salma)

Food Security Status and Seniors (unaddressed)

Notes:
Slide 56 provides the percentage of children in food-insecure households. This is useful for those working on nearby agencies' capacity.

 Finally, it was really fun to work with all of you and learn along the way. My sincere apologies for submitting the results about two hours late; I was finishing chapter 3 of the presentation.


Many thanks,
Mohamed
